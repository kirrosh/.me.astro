In this post, I will show you how to build a Tree component using [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8), a headless UI library for TypeScript/JavaScript, React, Vue, and Solid. TanStack Table provides the logic, state, processing, and API for building powerful tables and datagrids, making it easier to build complex UI components.
## Solid JS Example

Here is a Solid JS example with row selection, filtering, and sorting.

<SolidTree client:load />

## Why use TanStack Table for building Tree components?

- Full control over markup and styles: With TanStack Table, you have full control over the markup and styles of your Tree component, allowing you to create a custom and branded look and feel.
- Supports all styling patterns: Whether you prefer CSS, CSS-in-JS, or UI libraries, TanStack Table supports all styling patterns, giving you the flexibility to use the approach that works best for your project.
- Smaller bundle sizes: TanStack Table has a smaller bundle size compared to component-based libraries, making it a more lightweight option for building Tree components.
- Portable: TanStack Table is a headless library, meaning it can be run anywhere JavaScript runs, making it a portable option for building Tree components.

## Installation
To install TanStack Table, you can use npm:
```
Solid Table
$ npm install @tanstack/solid-table

or React Table
$ npm install @tanstack/react-table

or Table Core (no framework)
$ npm install @tanstack/table-core

```

You can install packages for Vue, Svelte, React, Solid, or use @tanstack/table-core with any other framework.

## Creating a Table

Here is a simple example of how to create a table with TanStack Table using Solid JS. You can use any other framework as well.

### Create a dataset with 3 levels of nesting

```ts
const [data, setData] = createSignal(makeData(10, 5, 3));
```

### Create columns

I will only display a few columns in this example. For a complete understanding, it's recommended to visit the official documentation: [Column Definitions](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/guide/column-defs). 
Here is an example of a text column:

```jsx
  {
    accessorKey: "firstName",
    cell: (info) => {
      return (
        <div
          class="mr-auto w-full cursor-pointer pl-2"
          onclick={info.row.getToggleExpandedHandler()}
        >
          {info.getValue<string>()}
        </div>
      );
    },
  },
```
And here is an example of a selection column:

```jsx
  {
    accessorKey: "select",
    cell: (info) => (
      <IndeterminateCheckbox
        {...{
          checked: info.row.subRows.length
            ? info.row.getIsAllSubRowsSelected()
            : info.row.getIsSelected(),
          disabled: !info.row.getCanSelect(),
          indeterminate: info.row.getIsSomeSelected(),
          onChange: (e) => {
            if (info.row.getIsSomeSelected()) {
              info.row.toggleSelected(false);
              return;
            }
            info.row.toggleSelected();
          },
        }}
      />
    ),
  }

```

### Creating the Table
Here's the code for creating a `table` object using `createSolidTable` function:

```js
const table = createSolidTable({
  get data() {
    return data();
  },
  state: {
    /** Table state could be controlled */
  },    
  columns,
  getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
  getExpandedRowModel: getExpandedRowModel(),
  getFilteredRowModel: getFilteredRowModel(),
  getSubRows: (row) => row.subRows,
  enableRowSelection: true,
});
```

### Creating the Tree Component
With the `table` object created, we now need to build a tree component. We will only use the table rows and cells and ignore features like header, footer, and pagination. Here's the code:
```jsx
<ul
    class="..."
  >
  <For each={table.getRowModel().rows}>
    {(row) => (
      <li
        class="flex cursor-pointer items-center gap-2"
        style={{
          "padding-left": 16 * row.depth + "px",
        }}
      >
        <For each={row.getVisibleCells()}>
          {(cell) =>
            flexRender(cell.column.columnDef.cell, cell.getContext())
          }
        </For>
      </li>
    )}
  </For>
</ul>
```
There's no need to use recursion as the table rows are already in a flat array. You can calculate the padding for each row using the `depth` property.
# Summary
TanStack Table provides a robust platform for constructing complex UI components, with an architecture that makes it suitable for building various tables, datagrids, and even tree components.
